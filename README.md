DataStructures
==============

Primitive data collections (char, int, float, long, double), including:
* array lists
* bags (unordered lists)
* sorted lists
* array views
* maps
* iterators
* read only interfaces

The primary purpose of these collections are to provide performance improvements over equivalent java collections such as HashMap and ArrayList.

Take a look at the 'test' package for some examples of how the API works.
